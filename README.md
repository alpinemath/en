# The Alpine Mathematics English Translations Library

This is a place for English translations of mathematical papers written in
other languages.

Generally speaking, translations of theorems and proofs do not belong here.
Instead, these should be added to the
[HistArch](https://github.com/alpinemath/histarch) project.

The present library -- called "En" for short -- is a place for translations of
"prose sections" of mathematical papers.


## How to contribute?

Contributing is easy. Basically, just fork this repository, add or improve some
modules, and make a pull request. However, please be sure to read the
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) first, and follow the guidelines stated
there.

The easiest way to develop Proofscape modules is by
[downloading and running PISE](https://alpinemath.org/download/pise.html),
the Proofscape Integrated Study Environment, on your own computer.

For an intro to PISE, you might want to try out
